=============================

This is my submission for Project 1 of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree. It was initially inspired by mid-century sci-fi and move posters.

The goal of the project was to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of
HTML and CSS markup, as well as the processes involved in working with 
responsive web design, and working with responsive images.

*Note: Links and navigation do not function as this was only a demonstration of specific aptitudes.*
